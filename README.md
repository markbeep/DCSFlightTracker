# DCSFlightTracker

This tool uses [Tacview](https://www.tacview.net/) files to total up all of your flight hours for each aircraft.

## How to use

1. Head to the [releases page](https://github.com/markbeep/DCSFlightTracker/releases) and download the latest exe file.
2. Make sure you're tracking your flights with Tacview ([Relevant DCS guide](https://tacview.fandom.com/wiki/User_Guide_%E2%80%93_DCS_World)).
3. Once you have a few flights tracked, you can simply open DCSFlightTracker, open your Tacview directory (usually located at `%USERPROFILE%/Documents/Tacview`) and click on `Analyze`.
4. It will take a few seconds to go through all files and parse every flight you tracked.
